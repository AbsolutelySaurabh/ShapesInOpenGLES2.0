# ShapesInOpenGLES2.0

This tutorial helps the Android developers who are beginners in OpenGLES2.0 to create various types of shape they would need to create an application. The tutorial is designed in such a way that one can straight away jump into the development of an Android OpenGL application instead of figuring out (core concepts) theoretically.

This is an attempt to simplify a developer's work so that he/she can focus more on the "IDEA" rather than the "IMPLEMENTATION" of the app.

> [*Utils*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Utils) folder has utility classes to compile shader, create texture, read shader from string and check gl errors.

> [*Shapes*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes) folder has shapes classes to create points, lines, triangles, quad, cubes, spheres, heightmap.(more to come soon!)

> [*raw*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/res/raw) folder has shader code for shapes.
