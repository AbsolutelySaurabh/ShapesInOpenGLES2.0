# ShapesInOpenGLES2.0

This tutorial help the Android developers who are beginners in OpenGLES2.0 to create various types of shape they would need to create an application. The tutorial is designed in such a way that one can straight away jump into the development of a Android OpenGL application instead of figuring out (core concepts) theoretically.

This is an attempt to simplify a developers work so that they can focus more on "IDEA" rather than "IMPLEMENTATION".  

> [*Utils*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Utils) folder has utility classes to compile shader, create texture, read shader from string and check gl errors.

> [*Shapes*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes) folder has shapes classes to create points, lines, triangles, quad.(more to come soon!)

> [*raw*](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/tree/master/app/src/main/res/raw) folder has shader code for shapes.

Shapes supported :-
* [Points](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes/Points.java)
* [Lines](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes/Lines.java)
* [Triangles](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes/Triangles.java)
* [Quads](https://github.com/regar007/ShapesInOpenGLES2.0/blob/master/app/src/main/java/com/regar007/shapesinopengles20/Shapes/Quad.java)
